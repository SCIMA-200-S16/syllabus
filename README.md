# syllabus
This course will introduce students to practical applications of physics, programming, and electronics by designing and building functional interactive electromechanical devices. This course will cover basic elements of programming (Processing and Arduino), electronics (basic circuits, Arduino, sensors and actuators), and physics (mechanics, dynamics, energy conversion, and structural forces). Concepts in math and physics will be reinforced through their application in designing, building, and programming electronic and electromechanical projects. The course assumes high school level competence in algebra and trigonometry. A laptop is highly recommended.
